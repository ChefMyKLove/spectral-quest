        <div class="section">
            <p>Before you learned to see, you learned to dream in colour!</p>
            
            <p>Yes, even from deep inside that dark and exuberantly riotous womb-space, you learned what the colours meant as they moved and fused to become the reality all around us, inside and out. Knowledge so innate that it BECAME you.</p>
            
            <p>You didn't even ever question the way that some shades of red made your heart race, or the way that a certain hue of blue could break it. The subtle way that yellow tastes like summer, or violet humming, dreamy like a lullaby, just before sleep, are sensations ingrained into your being from the very moment you became.</p>
            
            <p>And through it all, after all that you've been taught about it, you thought colour was physics: wavelengths showering the electromagnetic illusion of light onto the canvas of our eyes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>But chances are, you weren't taught the truth about the Unicorns.</p>
            
            <p>You weren't taught that colour IS the fabric that holds together every breath you take. What you were taught about Unicorns AND reality was wrong, or at least missing some crucial information: For example, did you know that somewhere beyond the veil of what you here in the third dimension call reality, magical herds of Unicorns are working with every fibre of their life force... just to keep you dreaming AND breathing?</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>This is not a fairy tale. Unicorns ARE real!</p>
            
            <p>Their unsung continuous and colourful labour of Love is the reason you cry at sunsets. It is why your first memory is drenched in a shimmer of golden echo, or why your last thought will bloom in shades we will never have a name for.</p>
            
            <p>Every emotion you've ever felt: every moment of joy that made the world glisten, or every grief or sorrow that has drained it into a dull grey, is there because Unicorns weave their rainbows into the fabric of existence itself.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>They are the Keepers of the Living Spectrum.</p>
            
            <p>The spectrum that underlies all of the reality you know, but one day, in a fit of corrupted obedience, one of the Unicorns shattered the Spectral core, and the world will never be the same.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>The catalyst to the Spectral Desaturation was Maxim Voss, a prodigal young Weaver born into the inner circle of the Spectral High Council: The Unicorns charged with maintaining the Aether for us all.</p>
            
            <p>Max's sharp, glistening silver horn, and eyes that could see light and shadow in perfect balance, yielded a rare gift known as dual-spectrum sight. With it, they could weave subtle pastels and luscious blurred shadows that no other Unicorn had ever dared attempt.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Their best forever friend and cousin Lirien Voss was another unique Unicorn who came from the same clerical lineage.</p>
            
            <p>Bestowed at birth with the mark of an evolved weaver, they could breathe perfectly balanced Rainbows through their horn, which they could then fashion into any manner of instrument or contraption. The scope of spectrum they were able to instantly create with every thought was a power that no Unicorn had ever even fathomed.</p>
            
            <p>Lirien's ability to create vast complexity out of a mere modicum of a notion was an evolution in weaving that the High Council had been keeping a close eye on.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-break">* * *</div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Together, growing up in the Garden of First Light, with the Spectrum Source as their potent palette, they danced a collaboration that made the Spectral Core resonate a vatic fount so prescient it transformed the nature of the Aether itself.</p>
            
            <p>Max would slide across Lirien's exhaled carpets of living colour, splashing their hooves with sparkling blues and violets; gradients of unknown greens and yellows so bright they were invisible! Where Maxim landed, new hues bloomed: shades that an unsuspecting humanity had never dreamed before.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>These two Unicorns were the next evolution of Weavers, pulling more colour from the Spectral Core than the Council thought possible.</p>
            
            <p>They were weaving a world so awe-inspiring, so exceptional and vast that it manifested as dreams and growth unprecedented in history. Their impact on the evolution of human emotion was heralding a new era in people's psychic and transcendent abilities.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>The impact their dancing had on the politics and procedures in the High Council chambers was another story altogether. The internal division it created set the stage for those horrific events that would change the world forever:</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>That fateful night High Cleric Voss, who had decided that fluidity was sin, and that his grandchild's gift was a threat to purity itself, took decisive action.</p>
            
            <p>Turning the immense and glorious power beam of the Spectral Core right onto the two young rainbow-weaving Unicorns, he put a swift end to their awesome generative dance. Maxim's silver horn was severed clean while Lirien's weaving was fatally corrupted and burned them up in mid-flight.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>In the violent aftermath of this destruction of the spectral weavers' sacred creation, High Cleric Voss banished the horribly burned and scarred Lirien to die in the depths of wild light of the Crimson Aether.</p>
            
            <p>His other grandchild was dragged into a stark surgical prison deep beneath the Violet crown of The High Council chambers. Voss didn't just sever Maxim's horn that night in the garden... He began rebuilding them completely.</p>

            <p>Ten years in those sombre depths beneath the council chambers.</p>
            
            <p>A decade spent grafting golden circuitry into living flesh and replacing Maxim's natural gifts with mechanical binary processors. Ten long years systematically erasing a consciousness that once perceived infinite gradients, reducing it to stark binaries of on and off.</p>
            
            <p>Endless tests and experiments. Countless failures leading to a final and grotesque success.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Voss called it "purification"—removing the weakness of fluidity, the corruption of organic evolution, the dangerous sin of infinite possibility, of Love without bounds.</p>
            
            <p>He was hard-coding the switches that would power a Desaturation Engine—the tool that would cement his vision of absolute dominion. And he was using his own grandchild as the prototype.</p>

        <div class="section-break">* * *</div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>His only son, Elarion Voss, had built a most effective device he called Essence Engine. Its purpose was to amplify magic, to help Unicorn Weavers interlace even more colour and beauty into the world.</p>
            
            <p>High Cleric Voss saw different potential for the machine: efficiency and control. He saw the Essence Engine, retooled with just the right inputs, as a way to replace the chaotic, unpredictable Living Spectrum with something pure. Something that was predictable and calculable. Something binary.</p>
            
            <p>So he stole it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>He banished his own son to the void-cages and began inverting the Engine—rewiring amplification circuits to drain, to extract, to compress the Spectrum's infinite chaos into zeros and ones.</p>
            
            <p>His grandchild became the Engine's output interface: dual-spectrum sight repurposed as a color-to-binary filter and extruder; hooves transformed into conduits, able to convert the spectral essence into fuel.</p>
            
            <p>Maxim's body would be the bridge between magic and machine, between the Living Spectrum and its annihilation into a new world!</p>

        <div class="chapter-title">The Shattering</div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>When Voss threw the switch, Maxim screamed.</p>
            
            <p>Not in pain—Grandfather's merciless modifications had erased that weakness. It was a scream of shock. It was the awe of that crystalline moment where every iota of everything could be perceived in an instant.</p>
            
            <p>Every shade humanity had ever dreamed. Every colour that had ever existed across all seven layers. The full infinite spectrum compressed through their dual-sight filter, reduced to binary, and channelled into the Engine's core.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>The High Cleric, fists clenched with a rage of anticipation, growled: "Now. Shatter it."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Maxim didn't want to.</p>
            
            <p>Somewhere beneath all of these new circuits, beneath the gold-fused horn and mechanical heart, a thirteen-year-old foal remembered dancing in starlight with their closest muse and conspirator. Remembered the moments of pure creation, the depth of their bond and the capacity they had as weavers of all of it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>But the modifications were complete. Obedience wasn't a choice—it was code.</p>
            
            <p>Any memories were peripheral to the mandate at hand. The Cleric's years of torture upon the young Unicorn had taken its toll and they sought only the end of what seemed to be a hopeless life. What grandfather had promised would be exactly what would bring an end to this internal confusion inside... and any reminders of the bliss of a life of Love once shared filled Max with an unbearable longing.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>The tortured cyborg unicorn, trembling but obedient, raised their golden horn, edging closer to the point of synapse with the humming, incandescent, infinite Spectral Core.</p>
            
            <p>And when the core sang into and through Maxim's reluctant touch, the Desaturation Engine surged and from their horn surged an energy unknown in the Spectral core.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>It didn't produce a rainbow. No colour at all was present.</p>
            
            <p>It pulsed with an unwavering line of code—a binary wrap—spectral essence inverted and compressed into raw data, and then weaponized. The same raw magic Weavers used to create beauty was now unmaking it... and when the wrap touched the Spectral Core, it froze, convulsed, and finally shattered.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>From the rupture, seven Harmony Shards spun into the void, each one carrying a chromatic fragment of what the Spectral Core had been.</p>
            
            <p>But in the shock of being split apart, they didn't remain whole. Torn from the Core's gravitational embrace, each shard sang itself apart into smaller pieces along its natural frequency.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>The red shard split into seven deep pulses—each Spectral Mote resonating like a bass note, heavy and grounding. They fell slowly through the void, burning like dying embers, every one carrying the weight of every passion ever felt.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Orange fractured into twelve rhythmic beats, synced to the heartbeat of time itself. The motes scattered across the Amber layer like clock chimes frozen mid-strike, each one ticking with the memory of moments that would never return.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>The yellow Harmony Shard burst into eighteen bright flashes, scattered like summer lightning. They danced through the wreckage, impossibly light, each one humming with the hush of laughter that had been silenced and a squelched joy that refused to die completely.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Green unravelled into twenty-four living spirals, spreading tendrils of growth and memory. The motes took root wherever they landed and sprouted ghost-vines that reached their empty husks outward in a confusing and hopeless grasp at growing.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>The blue shard shattered into thirty-five crystalline truths, each fragment reflecting a different angle of reality. They hung suspended in the void like individual frozen tears, holding a single honest moment. Every Mote the kind of truth that breaks hearts and builds worlds.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Indigo splintered into forty-four dream-shards, flickering between visible and invisible, real and imagined. Half-formed visions pulsed within each mote: futures that might have been, memories of things that never happened, the space between waking and sleep where anything was possible.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>And Violet—highest frequency, shortest wavelength, the layer closest to the Source—exploded into forty-nine trembling motes. The most fragile and scattered of the spectral motes. They vibrate so fast that they constantly phase between dimensions, visible only to those who can see the Spectrum complete.</p>

            <p>Lirien survived.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Sylvara found the young Weaver in the Crimson Aether ten years ago—ten years old, burned nearly beyond recognition, clutching a scrap of rainbow carpet. The same one they'd been dancing on with Maxim moments before High Cleric Voss turned the Spectral Core into a weapon against them.</p>
            
            <p>It awakened in them the memory of the bonding ceremony, where the prophecy was first sung from the Spectral Core into their heart.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Lirien had been born with a gift no unicorn had ever possessed: the ability to breathe perfectly balanced rainbows and to weave them into vast complexity from the smallest thought.</p>
            
            <p>But raw power without discipline is just chaos waiting to happen, Sylvara knew. So, in the caverns of singing crystal, together with the rebel dancers from each aetherial level they set to making this young Unicorn Weaver into the hero the prophecy foretold.</p>
            
            <p>Seven exiled Unicorns tasked with teaching one prodigy how to survive what was coming.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-break">* * *</div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>For ten years, covert intelligence filtered into the sanctuary. Rebel spies reported strange construction beneath the Violet Crown. Glimpses of cyborg experimentation. Rumours that Voss was building something that would "purify the Spectrum."</p>
            
            <p>The Dancers knew: something terrible was being prepared. They had to make Lirien ready for the worst.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Ember taught them combat—how to turn their rainbow carpets into shields that could withstand binary corruption, into nets that could cage drones, into spears of concentrated light. "Your gift makes beauty. I'll teach you to make it deadly," they would say to an uneasy Lirien. The thought of killing anyone or anything didn't make a lot of sense to them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Calen taught them tempo-casting under pressure—how to maintain perfect rhythm while the world shattered around them, how to sync their weaving to the Aether's pulse even when it was dying. These skills would be essential in any situation where the aether had been corrupted. Lirien was encouraged to explore resonance with various beats as a way to match tempo with the source.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Sol taught them emotional resilience: The power to hold onto joy when surrounded by gray. How to remember why colour mattered even when humanity forgot. The yellow hues have an important brightness and this energy can carry us. "Hope isn't weakness," they once told Lirien after a particularly emotional session, "It's the rebellion. Voss MUST be stopped!"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Veyra's teachings brought Lirien in touch with their sense of spatial strategy—how to see problems from angles no one else could find in an instant. They specialized in how to build platforms mid-flight and how to architect their own survival when it's suddenly on the line. Through Veyra, Lirien grew to know in the fibre of their being, that "Every impossible situation has a gap. You have to find it and exploit it."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Zorah taught them prophecy and the ways to read the threads of fate without becoming tangled in them. The keys therein open the knowledge of how to trust the path even when it led into obscurity or confusion. The wisdom of understanding that some truths exist in every timeline and that sometimes it is your time. "These times are the times for which you were born to shine, sweet one."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Nyx was the sage of shadow-work: Lirien learned how to step sideways through the veil between light and darkness and how to move unseen. How to dance through the void without fear. How to BE the underside of color.</p>
            
            <p>Nyx, who had been Maxim's first dance partner, before Lirien had understood the dance entirely, and was shattered them-self to know that they were gone, poured everything into making sure Lirien would be strong enough to finish what they couldn't start.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Through Sylvara, the elder of the dancers, Lirien learned the strength of endurance. They learned how to sustain a weave past the point of collapse and how to keep bridges alive when their spectral flame was fading. The way that intent moves energy when you need to carry the broken to safety, even when their own strength was nearly gone.</p>
            
            <p>They taught Lirien that growth doesn't stop in grief; it transforms through it. "Survival is its own kind of victory," they often said over those ten long years.</p>
            
            <p>And Sylvara, who had lost a sibling to save a cousin's child, made sure Lirien understood: this wasn't just a mission. It was family.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>But the hardest lessons came from carpet-riding itself.</p>
            
            <p>Lirien could weave anything they imagined, but learning to ride their creations at lethal speeds through collapsing dimensions—that took ten years of falls, crashes, and getting back up... again.</p>
            
            <p>Learning to cast new platforms while mid-leap or learning to reweave a disintegrating bridge while enemies tore at their flanks; all while efficiently gathering and storing the spectral energy, then tempering it: The art of efficient riding. Learning to tempo-shift through seven Spectral Layers without losing sync.</p>
            
            <p>By the time they turned twenty, Lirien could dance across the Aether like liquid light.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>And this morning—the day before their twentieth birthday, ten years after they were banished to die—suddenly they knew exactly what all this was for.</p>
            
            <p>The sanctuary's alarm crystals pulsed their warning which crescendo-ed instantly and shattered.</p>
            
            <p>The Spectral Core was under attack.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>The Dancers gathered at the sanctuary's edge, watching in horror as the Binary Wrap blitzed across the Aether while seven Harmony Shards spun into the void and were torn apart. The thing that they had been training Lirien to prevent all this time had finally happened... but they weren't close to being ready for just what had happened.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>On the security projection screens documenting the grim scene unfold, a cyborg Unicorn's face appeared. Grotesque. Half flesh, half circuit. Weathered and depleted. Golden horn. One silver eye, still gleaming with traces of who they'd been, one wheel of spinning code.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Lirien's breath caught in a gasp. "That's Maxim!"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Ten years. Ten years of training to stop whatever Voss was building. Ten years of wondering if their cousin was even still alive.</p>
            
            <p>And now they knew: Maxim WAS the weapon.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-break">* * *</div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>The Dancers gathered close, forming a circle around Lirien in the sanctuary's heart. The suddenness of the core's demise brought an urgency that they rode in stride as they formed a tight circle around Lirien, who was too awestruck to be scared. Too determined to dwell for long in this farewell.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Nyx pressed a shadow feather into Lirien's mane while Calen's hoof-beat tapped steady against their chest, helping to calm the anxious weaver. Sol wove yellow light through their horn and mane. It was audibly bright and true.</p>
            
            <p>Ember's forehead touched theirs, transferring warmth and Veyra's prism wing folded around their shoulders, refracting their grief into resolution. Zorah kissed their brow, leaving the weight of futures yet to come.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>And Sylvara—who had found them burned and dying, who had raised them through ten years of exile—wove one final vine into Lirien's mane. Green, glowing, alive.</p>
            
            <p>"Bring Aurelia's child home," they whispered.</p>
