        <h2>2. Project Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Overview (500 words max):</strong></p>
        
        <p>This project creates original visual artworks establishing the aesthetic universe of "Spectral Quest: Rainbow Craft," a queer-led fantasy video game and novel series featuring Lirien, a non-binary unicorn weaver, and their journey to save their cousin Maxim while restoring seven shattered rainbow layers. As a Nanaimo-based queer visual artist, I will develop comprehensive concept art for characters, environments, and promotional materials that center 2SLGBTQI+ narratives and introduce a powerful new queer protagonist into the cultural lexicon.</p>

        <p><strong>The Story:</strong> Ten years ago, High Cleric Voss weaponized the Spectral Core against two young unicorn weavers—Lirien and their cousin Maxim—whose collaborative rainbow-weaving threatened his vision of binary purity. Maxim's silver horn was severed, and over ten years of torture, they were transformed into a cyborg weapon powering the Desaturation Engine. Lirien, burned and exiled, was raised by seven rebel Dancers who each taught them crucial skills. Now 20 years old, Lirien must journey through seven fractured rainbow layers, collecting 159 Spectral Motes to restore the Harmony Shards and save Maxim from the machine that consumed them. This is a story about healing chosen family, not revenge—about weaving light through darkness.</p>

        <p><strong>Visual Art Focus:</strong> This intensive 8-week project will produce standalone visual artworks including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Character Designs (15 total):</strong> Lirien (non-binary protagonist with rainbow-weaving abilities), Maxim/Maximum (transformation from dancer to cyborg weapon), the Seven Dancers (Ember-crimson warrior, Calen-amber rhythm keeper, Sol-yellow healer, Sylvara-green growth weaver, Zorah-blue truth keeper, Nyx-indigo shadow dancer, Veyra-violet architect), High Cleric Voss (antagonist), supporting characters</li>
            <li><strong>Environment Concepts (7 layers):</strong> Each rainbow layer with distinct aesthetic—Crimson Aether (passion/foundation), Amber Layer (time/rhythm), Yellow Realm (joy/hope), Green Gardens (growth/healing), Blue Depths (truth/clarity), Indigo Dreams (prophecy/vision), Violet Crown (transcendence/source)</li>
            <li><strong>Key Scenes (10 illustrations):</strong> The Shattering (Spectral Core breaking), The Seven Dancers mentoring Lirien, Lirien riding rainbow carpets, the Desaturation Engine, pivotal prophecy moments</li>
            <li><strong>Promotional Materials:</strong> 10 printable posters (various sizes), 5 social media template sets for marketing, cover art concepts for novel series</li>
            <li><strong>Merchandise Prototypes:</strong> Unicorn stuffie designs (Lirien and Maxim versions), action figure concepts, collectible art prints</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Artistic Approach:</strong> The visual style blends traditional hand-sketching with digital illustration, emphasizing rainbow gradients, emotional depth through color theory, and non-binary aesthetics that reject rigid binaries. Using inks, paints, and digital tools (Photoshop, Procreate), I will create layered artworks exploring themes of identity, resilience, prophecy, and queer joy. Each of the seven rainbow layers will have distinct visual language tied to its thematic meaning and the Dancer who embodies it.</p>

        <p><strong>Community Impact:</strong> This project addresses severe underrepresentation of queer characters in gaming (only 2% feature LGBTQ+ leads, per GLAAD) and fantasy literature. By centering Lirien—a non-binary unicorn with they/them pronouns whose queerness is integral to their power—this work introduces a new queer icon into popular culture. Visual outputs will engage 500+ community members through beta testing with <a href="https://www.qmunity.ca/">QMUNITY</a>, <a href="https://www.bgccvi.com/generation-q/">Generation Q</a>, and <a href="https://viqueercollective.com/">VI Queer Collective</a>, with Pride Month 2026 launch activations. 10% of eventual merchandise proceeds will support Vancouver Island LGBTQ2SIA+ youth programs.</p>

        <p><strong>Rationale for Visual Arts Fit:</strong> While this universe extends into game and novel formats (funded separately), this application isolates the visual art creation as standalone fine art practice—concept art as contemporary illustration, promotional posters as graphic design, character sketches as character studies worthy of gallery exhibition. The work exists independently as visual storytelling that affirms queer identities through fantasy imagery.</p>

            <p>Grants Officer<br>
            BC Arts Council<br>
            2nd Floor, 800 Johnson Street<br>
            Victoria, BC V8W 1N3</p>

            <p>Dear Grants Officer,</p>

            <p>I am writing to submit my application for $11,250 under the Individual Arts Grants: Visual Artists program to create visual foundations for "Spectral Quest: Rainbow Craft," a comprehensive queer fantasy universe centered on Lirien, a non-binary unicorn weaver whose journey challenges binary conformity and affirms 2SLGBTQI+ resilience through the power of color, prophecy, and chosen family.</p>

            <p>As a Vancouver Island-based queer visual artist, I am passionate about addressing the severe underrepresentation of LGBTQ+ characters in fantasy gaming and literature. With only 2% of games featuring queer protagonists (GLAAD, 2025), there is urgent need for authentic, powerful queer heroes—particularly non-binary characters whose identities are integral to their strength rather than incidental. Lirien represents this evolution: a protagonist whose rainbow-weaving abilities, their/them pronouns, and queer relationships form the heart of their heroic journey.</p>

            <p>This 8-week intensive project will produce standalone visual artworks including 15 character designs, 7 environment concept paintings, 10 key scene illustrations, promotional posters, social media templates, and merchandise prototypes. The artistic approach blends traditional media (inks, paints) with digital illustration to create layered, emotionally resonant imagery exploring themes of identity, trauma recovery, and the revolutionary act of choosing beauty over violence.</p>

            <p>The project aligns strongly with BC Arts Council's equity priorities by centering underrepresented 2SLGBTQI+ narratives, engaging Vancouver Island queer communities through partnerships with QMUNITY, Generation Q, and VI Queer Collective, and creating economic opportunities through eventual merchandise sales (with 10% proceeds supporting Island LGBTQ2SIA+ youth programs). This work exists as fine art—concept illustration worthy of gallery exhibition—while also serving the broader cultural goal of establishing Lirien as an iconic queer character in the fantasy genre.</p>

            <p>Enclosed you will find: detailed project description, 8-week timeline, comprehensive budget totaling $11,250, my artist CV highlighting queer community engagement, visual portfolio demonstrating relevant artistic skills, and letters of support from community partners affirming the project's impact.</p>

            <p>I would be honored to receive BC Arts Council support for this work. The visual art created during this intensive will serve Vancouver Island's queer communities immediately while contributing to broader cultural representation of 2SLGBTQI+ narratives in fantasy media. I welcome any questions or requests for additional information.</p>

            <p>Thank you for considering "Spectral Quest: Rainbow Craft" for Individual Arts Grants funding.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rainbow Carpets:</strong> Lirien's signature magic—woven light paths they ride through the Aether</li>
                <li><strong>Spectral Motes:</strong> Glowing fragments (7 red, 12 orange, 18 yellow, 24 green, 35 blue, 44 indigo, 49 violet) scattered across layers</li>
                <li><strong>Binary Wrap:</strong> Visualized as grayscale corruption spreading like digital static, freezing color into black/white/gray</li>
                <li><strong>Desaturation Engine:</strong> Massive cyborg-organic machine pulsing beneath Violet Crown, tubes connecting to Maxim's body</li>
                <li><strong>Prophecy Symbols:</strong> Seven-pointed star (rainbow layers), shattered prism (broken Spectral Core), weaver's horn motif</li>
            </ul>
